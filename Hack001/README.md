## Python Library
NLTK

[Pandas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software))
> a library for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
> The name is derived from the term "panel data", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals.

[Numpy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy):
> a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

[SciPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciPy):
> a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing.
SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.
SciPy builds on the NumPy array object and is part of the NumPy stack which includes tools like Matplotlib, pandas and SymPy, and an expanding set of scientific computing libraries.
