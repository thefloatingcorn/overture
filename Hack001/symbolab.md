      * Geometric Series: r^n, |r| < 1
      * *p-Series*: \frac{1}{n^p}, p > 1
      * **Alternating Series**: a_n is positive and monotone decreasing from N with limit of 0 at infinity
      * **Telescoping Series**:
      * *Ratio Test*: \lim\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} < 1 for all n >= N
      * *Divergence Test*: \lim{a_n} != 0
      * *Comparison Test*: a_n < b_n for all n
      * *Limit Comparison Test*:
      * **Integral Test**:
    * *ABSOLUTE CONVERGENCE*: if \sum{|a_n|} is convergent
