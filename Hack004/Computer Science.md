[P/NP Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem#NP-completeness):
> It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (technically, verified in polynomial time) can also be solved quickly (again, in polynomial time).

[binary search trees (BST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree):
> sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees
> keys in sorted order, so that lookup and other operations can use the principle of binary search
