# Knowing data structure and algorithm

## Intro
Summarising basics of data structure and algorithm, based on the book,
[Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people, by Aditya Y. Bhargava](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/grokking-algorithms-an/9781617292231/).

## Pre

### Basic concepts
Big O notation: scalability
<!-- Memory/Addressing:  -->
<!-- Reading/Insertion/Deletion -->

### Data structure
Different forms of restrictions
* Array
* Stack
* Queue
* Hash
* Linked List
* Trees
* Graph
* Heap

## Algorithms

### Searching Problem
* Binary search
* Breadth-first search
* Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm

### Sorting Problem
* Selection sort
* Quick sort -> Divide & conquer
* Merge sort

<!-- ### Box Problem
* Recursion -->

### NP-complete problems
* The classroom scheduling problem
* The knapsack problem
* The set-covering problem
* The traveling salesperson
* Greedy algorithm
* Dynamic programming

<!-- ### Classification Problem:
k-nearest neighbors -->
