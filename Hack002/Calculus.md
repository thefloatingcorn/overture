* *Taylor/Maclaurin*
  * Taylor series of function f(x) at a is defined as:
  f\left(x\right)=f\left(a\right)+\frac{f^'\left(a\right)}{1!}\left(x-a\right)+\frac{f^{''}\left(a\right)}{2!}\left(x-a\right)^2+\frac{f^{'''}\left(a\right)}{3!}\left(x-a\right)^3+\ldots
  * Maclaurin series is a Taylor series at a = 0.
