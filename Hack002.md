Hacker:
> Originally term hacker meant someone who did the impossible with very little resources and much skill.
> The basic definition is “someone who makes fine furniture with an axe”.
> Hackers were the people who knew the computer inside and out and who could perform cool, clever, and impossible feats with their computers.

Hack:
> What makes a good hack?
> It involves go over, around, or through the limitations imposed by the machine, the compiler, management, security2 or anything else.
> True hackers develop tricks and techniques designed to overcome the obstacles in front of them and to improve the quality of the systems they work with.
> These are the true hacks.

Example:
> My first introduction to true hackers was when I joined the Midnight Computer Club when I went to college. This wasn't an official club, just a group of people who hung out in the PDP-8 lab after midnight to program and discuss computers.
> I remember one fellow who had taken $10 of parts from Radio Shack and created a little black box which he could use with an oscilloscope to align DECTape drives.  DEC at the time needed a $35,000 custom built machine to do the same thing.
> There were also some people there who enjoyed programming the PDP-8 to play music. This was kind of hard to do since the machine didn't have a sound card. But someone discovered that if you put a radio near the machine the interference could be heard on the speaker. After playing around with the system for a while people discovered how to generate tones using the interference and thus MUSIC-8 programming system was born.  So that the system didn't have a sound card didn't stop hackers from getting sound out of it. This illustrates one of the attributes of great hacks, doing the “impossible” with totally inadequate resources.
